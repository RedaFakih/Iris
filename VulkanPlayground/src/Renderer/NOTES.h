/*
 * - Doing Now: Clean up the logs that are coming from the shader compilation and reflection to look better
 * - Add all the complementary methods to the Shader class related to all the descriptor stuff...
 *
 *
 * NEXT STEP ON TUTORIAL: Images.
 *
 * NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
 * - Shader reflection to get descriptor data
 * - Pipeline abstraction
 * - Framebuffer abstraction
 * - Texture abstraction
 * - Images abstraction
 *
 * Brief Overview:
 *
 * - When we in the future we want to have a scene renderer and all that there will be one main command buffer that has its own abstraction
 * - Descriptor sets should be abstracted into a manager that manages them and manages their allocation via the command pool and all that
