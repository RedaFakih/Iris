Descriptor sets are ascending to their frequency of being bound (meaning higher sets are boudn the most {every frame})

 *	- Set 0 - 2: Global renderer stuff -> Least updated set (Global as in global for the current frame)
 *		- Set 0: Least updated set, should have the BRDF Texture
 *		- Set 1: UniformBuffers for general renderer data (Camera, Screen, Renderer and others...)
 *		- Set 2: Shadow data and lighting data (Point lights, spotlights, skylights, environment maps, shawdow maps, and others...)
 *  - Set 3: Per draw stuff -> Most updated set (materials...)

 The following are the buffers and images that will be bound to those sets...

layout(std140, set = 1, binding = 0) uniform Camera
{
	mat4 ViewProjectionMatrix;
	mat4 InverseViewProjectionMatrix;
	mat4 ProjectionMatrix;
	mat4 InverseProjectionMatrix;
	mat4 ViewMatrix;
	mat4 InverseViewMatrix;
	vec2 DepthUnpackConsts;
} u_Camera;

layout(std140, set = 1, binding = 1) uniform ScreenData
{
    vec2 FullResolution;
    vec2 InverseFullResolution;
    vec2 HalfResolution;
	vec2 InverseHalfResolution;
} u_ScreenData;

struct DirectionalLight
{
	vec4 Direction; // The alpha channel is the ShadowAmount
	vec4 Radiance; // The alpha channel is the multiplier of the directional light
};

layout(std140, set = 1, binding = 2) uniform SceneData
{
	DirectionalLight DirLight;
	vec3 CameraPosition; // Offset 32
	float EnvironmentMapIntensity; // This is used in the PBR shader and it mirrors the intensity that is used in the Skybox shader
} u_Scene;
